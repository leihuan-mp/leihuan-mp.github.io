I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computational Mathematics, Science, and Engineering](https://cmse.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. 
I also hold a joint position in the [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/).  My research interests lie in applied mathematics and 
scientific computing, in particular, multi-scale modeling and model reduction with applications to fluid physics, materials science, and 
biophysics. Currently, my group is devoted to developing data-driven algorithms to learn reliable and physics-interpretable models of 
meso-scale fluids and hydrodynamic transport processes directly from the first-principle-based descriptions.
