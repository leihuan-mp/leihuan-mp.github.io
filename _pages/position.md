We are currently open for two Ph.D. and one postdoc position starting in Fall 2023. The research project aims to establish accurate modeling of multi-scale dynamic systems relevant to 
meso-scale transport, non-Newtonian hydrodynamics, and kinetic transport processes. 
For such problems, the multi-scale and high-dimensional nature imposes a fundamental challenge; empirical models based on ad-hoc closure assumptions often show limitations. My group
is devoted to constructing machine-learning based models for such systems directly from the first-principle-based descriptions. In particular, we focus on developing numerical methods to learn 
reliable and numerically-stable models that faithfully entail the micro-scale interactions, retain physical interpretation, and respect physical constraints. 
If you are interested, please contact me by [email](mailto:leihuan@msu.edu).
