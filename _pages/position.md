We are currently open for two Ph.D. and one postdoc position starting in Fall 2023. The research aims to establish accurate modeling of multi-scale dynamic systems relevant to 
meso-scale transport, non-Newtonian hydrodynamics, and kinetic transport processes. 
For such problems, the multi-scale and high-dimensional nature imposes a fundamental challenge; empirical models based on ad-hoc closure assumptions often show limitations. My group
is devoted to developing machine-learning based models for such systems directly from the first-principle-based descriptions. In particular, we focus on the numerical methods to construct
reliable and numerically-stable models that faithfully entail the micro-scale interactions, retain physical interpretation, and respect physical constraints. The long-term
goal is to achieve *predictive modeling* of these multi-scale systems beyond phenomenologically understanding and establish integrated control across multiple scales. 
If you are interested, please contact me by [email](mailto:leihuan@msu.edu).
